## 🏆 My Recommendations

### 🥇 Best Choice: Hostinger (If you have VPS/Cloud)

**Why:**
- ✅ You're already paying for it
- ✅ Zero new subscriptions
- ✅ Full control over your backend
- ✅ Supports all features (WebSocket, MQTT, real-time)
- ✅ Can scale with your plan

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ You have basic shared hosting (no Node.js)
- ❌ You don't want to manage servers
- ❌ You want automatic deployments from GitHub

**Setup difficulty**: Medium (requires SSH, but I'll guide you)

---

### 🥈 Second Choice: Railway

**Why:**
- ✅ Easiest setup (20 minutes)
- ✅ Auto-deploys from GitHub
- ✅ Free tier is generous ($5 credit = ~500 hours/month)
- ✅ Great monitoring and logs
- ✅ Supports all features

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ You want absolute zero new services
- ❌ You're concerned about service changes (Railway pricing may change)

**Setup difficulty**: Easy (click and configure)

---

### 🥉 Third Choice: Render

**Why:**
- ✅ Easy setup
- ✅ Auto-deploys from GitHub
- ✅ Good free tier

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Service sleeps after 15 min (first request will be slow)
- ⚠️ Spin-up time can be 30-60 seconds

**Setup difficulty**: Easy

---

### 🤔 Consider If: Vercel Functions

**Only if:**
- You want everything in one Vercel account
- You're okay with limited real-time features
- You can wait 2-3 hours for code restructuring

**Not recommended because:**
- ❌ MQTT support is problematic
- ❌ WebSocket connections are limited
- ❌ Major code restructuring needed
