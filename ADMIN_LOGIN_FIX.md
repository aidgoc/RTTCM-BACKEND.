# 🔧 Admin Login Fix - Password Double-Hashing Issue

## 🐛 The Problem

When creating a company and admin account, the admin **couldn't login** even with the correct password. The logs showed:
```
Password valid: false
```

### Root Cause
The password was being **double-hashed**:
1. **First hash**: In `backend/src/routes/companies.js`, we manually hashed the password with `bcrypt.hash(adminPassword, 10)`
2. **Second hash**: The User model's `pre('save')` hook detected the `passwordHash` field was modified and hashed it AGAIN
3. Result: A double-hashed password that couldn't be verified during login

## ✅ The Fix

### Backend Fix
**File**: `backend/src/routes/companies.js`

**Before** (Line 281-282):
```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(adminPassword, 10);
const adminUser = new User({
  passwordHash: hashedPassword, // Already hashed
  ...
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Don't hash manually - User model pre-save hook will handle it
const adminUser = new User({
  passwordHash: adminPassword, // Plain password - will be hashed by pre-save hook
  ...
});
```

**Why it works**: The User model's `pre('save')` hook automatically hashes any password set in the `passwordHash` field. By passing the plain password, we let the model handle the hashing consistently.

## 🎨 UX Improvement: Role Selector Dropdown

### Before
- Checkbox: "Login as Super Admin"
- Users had to check/uncheck to specify role
- Not intuitive for different roles

### After
**File**: `frontend/pages/login.jsx`

- **Dropdown selector** with 5 role options:
  - 🏢 Admin (Company Administrator)
  - 👔 Manager
  - 👷 Supervisor
  - 🎮 Operator
  - ⭐ Super Admin (DCE Only)

- **Dynamic UI**:
  - When "Super Admin" is selected → Shows Head Office ID field with yellow highlight
  - For other roles → Shows a blue info box about which dashboard they'll see
  - Button text changes based on role selection

- **Better Visual Feedback**:
  - Head Office ID has yellow border and background (stands out)
  - Warning message: "This field is only for Dynamic Crane Engineers Super Admin"
  - Success toast shows role: "Welcome back, Admin!"

## 🧪 How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Create a Company (as Super Admin)
1. Login as Super Admin with Head Office ID
2. Go to Super Admin Dashboard
3. Click "Add New Company"
4. Fill in company details:
   - Company Name: **Test Corp Ltd**
   - Contact Person: **John Doe**
   - Email: **john@testcorp.com**
   - Phone: **+91 9876543210**
   - **Admin Name**: **John Doe**
   - **Admin Password**: **TestPass123**
   - Devices: 10
   - Price: 5000
5. Submit form
6. Modal appears with credentials:
   ```
   Email: john@testcorp.com
   Password: TestPass123
   ```
7. Copy credentials

### Step 2: Test Admin Login
1. Logout from Super Admin
2. Go to login page
3. **Select role**: "🏢 Admin (Company Administrator)" from dropdown
4. Enter credentials:
   - Email: `john@testcorp.com`
   - Password: `TestPass123`
   - **DO NOT** enter Head Office ID (field doesn't show for Admin)
5. Click "Sign in as Admin"
6. ✅ **Success!** Admin should login and be redirected to their dashboard

### Step 3: Verify Password Works
- Backend logs should show:
  ```
  Login attempt for email: john@testcorp.com
  User found: Yes
  User role: admin
  Password valid: true  ← Should be TRUE now!
  ```

## 🔐 Login Flow for Each Role

### Super Admin (Dynamic Crane Engineers)
```
Dropdown: ⭐ Super Admin (DCE Only)
Email: superadmin@dce.com
Password: your-password
Head Office ID: DCE-HO-123456 ← REQUIRED
```

### Admin (Company Administrator)
```
Dropdown: 🏢 Admin (Company Administrator)
Email: admin@clientcompany.com
Password: (set by Super Admin)
Head Office ID: (field hidden) ← NOT REQUIRED
```

### Manager
```
Dropdown: 👔 Manager
Email: manager@clientcompany.com
Password: (set by Admin)
Head Office ID: (field hidden)
```

### Supervisor
```
Dropdown: 👷 Supervisor
Email: supervisor@clientcompany.com
Password: (set by Admin/Manager)
Head Office ID: (field hidden)
```

### Operator
```
Dropdown: 🎮 Operator
Email: operator@clientcompany.com
Password: (set by Admin/Manager/Supervisor)
Head Office ID: (field hidden)
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### Password Hashing Flow
```
1. Super Admin creates company with plaintext password "TestPass123"
   ↓
2. Backend receives: adminPassword = "TestPass123"
   ↓
3. Create User with: passwordHash = "TestPass123" (plain)
   ↓
4. User.save() triggers pre('save') hook
   ↓
5. Hook detects passwordHash modified
   ↓
6. Hook hashes with bcrypt.hash(password, salt) with salt=12
   ↓
7. Stored in DB: "$2a$12$XYZ..." (properly hashed once)
   ↓
8. During login: bcrypt.compare("TestPass123", "$2a$12$XYZ...")
   ↓
9. ✅ Password matches!
```

### Why the Old Method Failed
```
1. Manual hash: bcrypt.hash("TestPass123", 10)
   Result: "$2a$10$ABC..."
   ↓
2. Set passwordHash = "$2a$10$ABC..." (already hashed)
   ↓
3. User.save() triggers pre('save') hook
   ↓
4. Hook hashes AGAIN: bcrypt.hash("$2a$10$ABC...", 12)
   Result: "$2a$12$XYZ..." (double hashed!)
   ↓
5. During login: bcrypt.compare("TestPass123", "$2a$12$XYZ...")
   ↓
6. ❌ Password doesn't match! (comparing plain to double-hash)
```
