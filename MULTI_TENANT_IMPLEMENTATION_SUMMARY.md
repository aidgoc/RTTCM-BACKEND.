## 🔐 New Role Hierarchy

```
Super Admin (Dynamic Crane Engineers Staff)
    ↓ can create
  Admin (Client Company Admin)
    ↓ can create
  Manager
    ↓ can create
  Supervisor
    ↓ can create
  Operator
```

---

## 🏢 Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

### How It Works:
1. **Super Admin**:
   - No company assignment
   - Can view/manage ALL companies
   - Has `headOfficeId` instead of `companyId`

2. **Company Admin**:
   - Created by Super Admin
   - Assigned to specific company
   - Can create managers within their company

3. **Other Roles** (Manager, Supervisor, Operator):
   - Created by their hierarchy level
   - Automatically assigned to same company as creator
   - Can ONLY see data from their own company

### Security:
- All API calls include `enforceCompanyIsolation` middleware
- Database queries automatically filter by `companyId`
- Super Admin bypasses company filter

---

## 📝 Head Office ID System

### Purpose:
- Additional security layer for Super Admin access
- Acts as a "master password" for Dynamic Crane Engineers staff

### Implementation:
- **Signup**: Required field when role is "superadmin"
- **Login**: Must provide headOfficeId to login as superadmin
- **Security**: Stored in database, validated on each login
- **Frontend**: Shows as password field for security

### Recommendation:
Set a strong Head Office ID like: `DCE-2024-SECURE-KEY-XYZ789`
