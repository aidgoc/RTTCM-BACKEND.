# Current Issues & Solutions

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- MongoDB Atlas is set up and has data (5 cranes, 3 users, 50 telemetry records, 5 tickets)
- MongoDB connection tested successfully
- Git repository set up and pushed to GitHub
- Backend code is ready to deploy

### ‚ùå What's NOT Working:
1. **Frontend has build errors** - "NextRouter was not mounted" error
2. **Backend is NOT deployed** - No API server running
3. **Frontend shows 404** - Build fails, cannot deploy

---

## üî¥ Problem 1: Frontend Build Errors

**Error**: `NextRouter was not mounted`

**Cause**: Components are trying to use Next.js router during static site generation (SSG) but router isn't available at build time.

**Solution**: We need to disable static generation for pages that use the router or fix router usage in components.

### Quick Fix Option 1: Disable Static Generation

Add this to pages that are failing:

```javascript
// Add to each failing page
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return { props: {} };
}
```

### Quick Fix Option 2: Fix Router Usage in Layout/Sidebar

The issue is likely in `Sidebar.jsx` or `layout.jsx` where router is used at the top level.

---

## üî¥ Problem 2: Backend Not Deployed

**Impact**: Frontend can't connect to API, causing 404 errors

**Solution**: Deploy backend to Railway NOW (don't wait for frontend fix)

### Why Deploy Backend First?
1. Frontend can be fixed separately
2. Backend deployment is independent
3. You can test backend API directly
4. MongoDB is ready and waiting

---

## üéØ Action Plan (In Order)

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway (15 minutes) - DO THIS FIRST!

1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Create new project from `REAL-TIME-TOWER-CRANE` repo
4. Set root directory to `backend`
5. Add environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3001
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://craneadmin:crane950@cluster0.5wgbbex.mongodb.net/cranefleet?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-minimum-32-characters-long
   FRONTEND_URL=https://real-time-tower-crane.vercel.app
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://real-time-tower-crane.vercel.app
   MQTT_BROKER_URL=mqtt://broker.hivemq.com:1883
   TOPIC_TELEMETRY=crane/+/telemetry
   TOPIC_STATUS=crane/+/status
   TOPIC_LOCATION=crane/+/location
   TOPIC_TEST=crane/+/test
   TOPIC_ALARM=crane/+/alarm
   TOPIC_HEARTBEAT=crane/+/heartbeat
   BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
   ENABLE_REDIS=false
   ENABLE_MQTT=true
   ENABLE_SOCKET_IO=true
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   ```
6. Deploy and get your Railway URL
7. Test: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health`

### Step 2: Fix Frontend Router Issues (20 minutes)

**Option A: Quick Fix - Disable Static Generation**

Create this file to disable SSG for all pages:

```javascript
// frontend/next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  swcMinify: true,
  env: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:3001",
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL || "ws://localhost:3001",
  },
  // Disable static optimization for all pages
  experimental: {
    outputStandalone: false,
  },
  // Force dynamic rendering
  output: 'standalone',
};
```

**Option B: Proper Fix - Fix Router Usage**

The issue is in a component (likely Sidebar or Layout) that uses `useRouter()` at the top level. We need to:
1. Wrap router usage in useEffect
2. Check if router is ready before using it
3. Add null checks

### Step 3: Update Vercel Environment Variables

After backend is deployed:

```bash
cd frontend
vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production
vercel env rm NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL production
echo "https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app" | vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production
echo "https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app" | vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL production
```

### Step 4: Redeploy Frontend

```bash
vercel --prod
```

---

## üö® IMPORTANT: Do Backend First!

**Don't wait for frontend to be fixed!**

The backend can be deployed and working independently. You can:
- Test API endpoints directly
- Use Postman/Insomnia to test
- Login with test users
- Query crane data
- Everything works without the frontend

Once backend is live, fixing the frontend is easier because you can test against real API.

---

## üí° Alternative: Use Hostinger Instead

If Railway is giving you trouble, you can use Hostinger (if you have VPS/Cloud):
- Deploy backend to Hostinger
- No build errors (it's just running Node.js)
- Full control over the setup

---

## üìù Summary

### Current Blocker:
Frontend build errors preventing deployment

### Solution Priority:
1. ‚úÖ **Deploy backend first** (doesn't depend on frontend)
2. ‚úÖ **Fix frontend router issues** (can be done after)
3. ‚úÖ **Connect them together** (update environment variables)

### Time Estimate:
- Backend deployment: 15-20 minutes
- Frontend fix: 20-30 minutes  
- Total: 35-50 minutes to fully working app

---

## üéØ What To Do Right Now:

1. **Stop trying to deploy frontend** (it has errors)
2. **Deploy backend to Railway** (follow Step 1 above)
3. **Tell me when backend is deployed** (share Railway URL)
4. **I'll fix the frontend router issue** (while you deploy backend)
5. **Then we connect them**

**The app will work once both are deployed!** üöÄ
